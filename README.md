# MiataTroubleshooting
This is a website I made based on an old forum post https://forum.miata.net/vb/showthread.php?t=279746. The post is a long and thorough troubleshooting tree for first and second gen miatas, but the formatting is basically non-existent and it is hard to process that wall of text. So I turned it into an interactive website!
